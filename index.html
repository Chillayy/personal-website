        Hello! My name is Shemar Pradia and I am an aspiring Game Developer.
        Right now, I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java. I am a rising
        senior in Kashmere High School and will be graduating summer of 2024. I
        am an avid gamer that plays a large variety of games as long as they are
        fun, and I also love to watch anime and make games in my free time. I
        believe that failure is necessary in order to achieve true success. I
        will continue to pursue my dream and work hard towards my goals to
        establish what I want to do in life. Overall, I look forward to the
        challenges and obstacles that life throws at me with a strong sense of
        courage and perserverance.
